Project Description:
This QR Code Generator allows users to quickly generate QR codes based on any input text or URL. Users can simply enter the desired content and click the "Generate QR Code" button to instantly create a scannable QR code. The project is easy to use and provides a clear, functional interface.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the webpage, including the input field, button, and QR code display area.
CSS: For styling the web page to ensure it looks clean and professional with a responsive, centered layout.
JavaScript: Implements the logic to take user input and generate the QR code dynamically.
QRCode.js Library: A JavaScript library that handles the generation of the QR code based on the provided input.
How It Works:
The user enters a text or URL in the input field.
Upon clicking the "Generate QR Code" button, the JavaScript code captures the input and passes it to the QRCode.js library.
The QRCode.js library generates the QR code, which is displayed on the page.
